<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to RCA Logbook System</h1>
<p class="text-center">The RCA logbook system is a crucial tool for organizations to systematically document and analyze root causes of incidents or problems. By maintaining a comprehensive logbook, teams can track the sequence of events leading up to an issue, identify contributing factors, and implement effective solutions to prevent recurrence. This systematic approach promotes transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement within an organization. Additionally, the RCA logbook serves as a valuable knowledge base, allowing future incidents to be addressed more efficiently by referring to past resolutions. In essence, the RCA logbook system plays a vital role in enhancing operational efficiency, mitigating risks, and fostering a culture of learning and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>The RCA logbook operates on the principles of CRUD:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create:</strong> Incidents or problems are logged into the system, capturing relevant details such as date, time, location, and description.</li>
        <li><strong>Read:</strong> Users can access the logbook to review past incidents, including their root causes, analysis, and resolutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Update:</strong> As new information becomes available or additional analysis is conducted, entries in the logbook can be updated to reflect the latest findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> In some cases, entries may need to be removed or archived, especially if they are no longer relevant or if data privacy concerns arise.</li>
